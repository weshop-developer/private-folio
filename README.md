[![Deploy to Cloudflare Pages](https://deploy.workers.cloudflare.com/button)](https://deploy.workers.cloudflare.com/?url=https://github.com/tigerlaibao/private-folio)

*Note: Please replace `tigerlaibao` in the URL above with your actual GitHub username if you fork this.*

## How it Works
1. **Fork** this repository.
2. Click the **Deploy** button above.
3. Follow the Cloudflare prompts to connect your GitHub account.
4. Cloudflare will automatically:
   - Create a D1 Database (`portfolio-db`).
   - Build and deploy the Next.js frontend.

## 🔄 How to Update
Since this is a self-hosted (BYOC) application, you are in full control of the code. To get the latest features or bug fixes:
1. Go to your forked repository on GitHub.
2. Click **"Sync fork"** (under the green Code button).
3. Cloudflare Pages will detect the change and automatically redeploy the new version.

## Features
- **Zero Knowledge**: Data is encrypted in your browser before being sent.
- **Serverless**: Runs entirely on Cloudflare Pages & D1.
- **Free**: Fits well within Cloudflare's free tier.

## Local Development

```bash
npm install
npm run preview # To run with Wrangler (simulating D1)
# or
npm run dev     # Standard Next.js dev server
```
